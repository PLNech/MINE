## 8. Development Process

### 8.1 Development Phases
1. **Foundation (2 weeks)**
   - Project setup with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind
   - Core game state management
   - Basic map rendering
   - Aesthetic implementation of paper/period styling

2. **Core Loop Implementation (3 weeks)**
   - Salary mechanism implementation
   - Worker management system
   - Building placement logic
   - Weekly progression cycle
   - Tutorial introduction

3. **System Integration (3 weeks)**
   - Mine, Store, and People layers
   - Event system with reality checks
   - Building relationships
   - Narrative system with journal entries

4. **Progression Implementation (2 weeks)**
   - Town scale milestones
   - Unlockable mechanics
   - Visual evolution with town growth
   - Achievement system and sharing

5. **Polish & Testing (2 weeks)**
   - Performance optimization
   - Bug fixing
   - User testing feedback implementation
   - Browser compatibility verification
   - Tutorial refinement based on playtesting

### 8.2 Testing Approach
- Unit tests for core game mechanics and formulas
- Integration tests for system interactions
- Automated browser compatibility testing
- Manual playtest sessions with feedback collection
- Performance profiling and optimization
- First-time user experience testing (no prior explanation)

## 9. Deployment

### 9.1 Vercel Deployment Requirements
- Next.js project optimized for Vercel platform
- Environment variables for configuration
- Build script optimizations for asset delivery
- Analytics integration for usage monitoring

### 9.2 Release Strategy
- Alpha release: Core gameplay only (internal testing)
- Beta release: Full systems with limited aesthetic polish
- Public MVP: Complete core experience with tutorial
- Post-launch updates based on player feedback and metrics

## 10. Risk Assessment and Contingency Plans

### 10.1 Technical Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Performance issues with large towns | Medium | High | Implement entity pooling, visibility culling, and optimization passes at milestones |
| Browser compatibility issues | Medium | Medium | Progressive enhancement approach, fallback styling for older browsers |
| Mobile experience limitations | High | Low | Focus on desktop experience first, design mobile view for monitoring rather than full control |
| Save data corruption | Low | High | Multiple save slots, backup system, export/import functionality |

### 10.2 Gameplay Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Initial experience too confusing | Medium | High | Implement robust but unobtrusive tutorial system, first-time user testing |
| Balance issues (too easy/hard) | High | Medium | Configurable difficulty settings, tunable parameters in config file |
| Progression too slow/fast | Medium | Medium | Analytics on playtesting, adjustable progression speeds |
| Mechanics not intuitive | Medium | High | Clear cause-effect relationships, real-time feedback, tooltips |

### 10.3 Common Failure Points and Solutions

1. **New Player Abandonment**
   - Risk: Players quit before understanding core loop
   - Solution: Ensure satisfying feedback within first 3 minutes
   - Measurement: First-session retention analytics

2. **Mid-game Complexity Cliff**
   - Risk: Too many systems unlock simultaneously
   - Solution: Staggered introduction of mechanics with mastery checkpoints
   - Measurement: Track time spent in each game phase

3. **System Incoherence**
   - Risk: Players can't understand how systems interconnect
   - Solution: Visual representation of cause-effect relationships
   - Measurement: User testing with "explain how X affects Y" tasks

4. **Balance Deterioration Over Time**
   - Risk: Late-game becomes trivial or impossible
   - Solution: Progressive challenge scaling, tunable difficulty factors
   - Measurement: Win/loss rates at different game stages

### 10.4 Scope Management

If development falls behind schedule, features will be prioritized in this order:

1. **Must Have**:
   - Core salary mechanism and worker migration
   - Basic town layout and building placement
   - Economic production and consumption cycle
   - Save/load functionality
   - Paper aesthetic with basic evolution

2. **Should Have**:
   - Worker journals and narrative events
   - Building relationship mechanics
   - Ethical choice system
   - Achievement sharing

3. **Could Have**:
   - Advanced visual evolution stages
   - Complex production chains
   - Multiple challenge modes
   - Detailed animations
   - Sound design
