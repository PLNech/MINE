> In some situations, company towns developed out of a paternalistic effort to create a utopian worker’s village. Churches, schools, libraries, and other amenities were constructed in order to encourage healthy communities and productive workers. Saloons or other places or services believed to be negative influences were prohibited.
> 
> In other cases, the company’s motivations were less ideal. The remoteness and lack of transportation prevented workers from leaving for other jobs or to buy from other, independent merchants. In some cases, companies paid employees with a scrip that was only good at company stores. Without external competition, housing costs and groceries in company towns could become exorbitant, and the workers built up large debts that they were required to pay off before leaving. Company towns often housed laborers in fenced-in or guarded areas, with the excuse that they were “protecting” laborers from unscrupulous traveling salesmen. In the South, free laborers and convict laborers were often housed in the same spaces, and suffered equally terrible mistreatment.
> Origins
> 
> Traditional settings for company towns were for the most part where extractive industries existed– coal, metal mines, lumber — and had established a monopoly franchise. Dam sites and war-industry camps founded other company towns. Since company stores often had a monopoly in company towns, it was possible to pay in scrip (a term for any substitute for legal tender). Typically, a company town is isolated from neighbors and centered on a large production factory, such as a lumber or steel mill or an automobile plant; and the citizens of the town either work in the factory, work in one of the smaller businesses, or is a family member of someone who does. The company may also donate a church building to a local congregation, operate parks, host cultural events such as concerts, and so on. If the owning company cuts back or goes out of business, the economic effect on the company town is devastating, as people move to jobs elsewhere.
> 
> Company towns often become regular public cities and towns as they grew and attracted other business enterprises, pool transportation and services infrastructure. Other times, a town may not officially be a company town, but it may be a town where the majority of citizens are employed by a single company, thus creating a similar situation to a company town (especially in regard to the town’s economy).

The game lore and copy should:

    Be subtle, not revealing overtly the game's political or social commentary.

    Embrace a darkly humorous tone that lightly highlights the absurdity of company towns.

    Use witty wordplay and ironic observations to underscore the power imbalance.

    Create colorful, Pratchett-esque metaphors that compare workers to cogs, money to lifeblood, or the company store to a Venus flytrap.

    Employ sardonic asides that break the fourth wall, winking at the player's role in perpetuating the system.

    Invent ridiculous company policies or slogans that sound positive but hint at underlying exploitation.

    Describe mundane aspects of company town life with exaggerated gravity or mock-heroic language.

    Use comically bureaucratic language to obscure ethically questionable practices.

    Create amusing, on-the-nose names for locations, characters, or products that hint at their true nature.

    Pepper the text with deadpan observations about the circular logic of company town economics.

    Craft dialogue for NPCs that showcases their blind acceptance of, or quiet rebellion against, the absurd status quo.

Remember, the goal is to make players chuckle while also making them think about the implications of their actions in the game world.
