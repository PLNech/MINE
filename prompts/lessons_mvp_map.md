20 Key Lessons for Implementing an Organically Evolving Factory Town Map

Based on the implementation of the procedural town generator for "This Town Is Mine," here are the most important lessons for developers looking to create similar organic factory town maps:

    Fractal Growth Pattern - Position factories in tiers, where sub-factories branch from main factories in the general direction of their parent, creating natural growth corridors.
    Non-Linear Scaling - Use logarithmic or exponential scaling for town radius based on population to ensure realistic density at different scales.
    Tiered Building Placement - Define clear hierarchy of buildings (mine → primary factories → secondary factories) and place important buildings first.
    Junction-Based Road System - Build road networks by connecting key junctions rather than using a strict grid, allowing for more organic layouts.
    Curved Roads - Add slight curves to roads using control points rather than straight lines to create more natural pathways.
    Different Road Types - Implement a hierarchy of roads (main, secondary, tertiary) with different widths to visually communicate importance.
    Angle Variation - Add randomized angle variation to branches from the same junction to avoid artificial-looking symmetry.
    Dynamic Zoom Adjustment - Automatically adjust zoom level based on town size to maintain appropriate view at different scales.
    Collision Detection - Implement proper collision detection when placing buildings to avoid overlaps.
    Progressive Detail - Increase visual detail and complexity gradually as town scale increases.
    Seed-Based Randomness - Use a seeded random function to ensure reproducible results while maintaining variety.
    Boundary Constraints - Keep new elements within reasonable town radius, with check that elements don't stray too far from center.
    Industry-Centric Growth - Place residential and commercial buildings along roads extending from industrial centers to simulate realistic development patterns.
    Organic Irregularity - Introduce "organic factor" parameter to control how much irregularity appears in the town layout.
    Building Importance - Place more important buildings at key junctions and less important buildings along secondary roads.
    Road Network Density - Make road network density configurable to simulate different urban planning styles.
    Tier-Specific Parameters - Use different parameters for different tiers of buildings (like maximum branches decreases as tier increases).
    Visual Evolution - Adjust the visual style based on town scale, with rougher sketches for smaller settlements and more detailed drawings for cities.
    Immediate Visual Feedback - Update the town visualization whenever key parameters change to show immediate impact of adjustments.
    Simulation Controls - Provide intuitive controls for growing the town over time, allowing observation of organic development patterns.

These lessons focus on creating believable, organic growth patterns that reflect how real industrial towns historically developed, with industry at the center and residential/commercial areas emerging around transportation networks.
